POE supports nearly any event loop imaginable through POE::Loop plugin
modules.  POE::Loop::Event is the plugin support for Joshua Pritikin's
Event module.

See http://search.cpan.org/search?query=POE%3A%3ALoop&mode=module for
a list of other event loops POE supports.

POE::Loop documents the generic API for all POE::Loop subclasses.  You
are invited to implement this API for your favorite event loop.
Kudos, bug reports, and patches are also welcome.

Thank you!
